# EMG Signal Classification Analysis  

## General Observations  

### Classifier Performance  
- **SVM**: Generally performs best, achieving the highest mean accuracy across multiple feature types and muscles.  
- **Random Forest & Decision Tree**: Show variable performance; Decision Tree often outperforms Random Forest for Frequency-Domain features.  
- **KNN**: Underperforms compared to SVM, particularly for Frequency-Domain and Wavelet features.  

### Feature Type Performance  
- **Wavelet Features**: Perform well for certain muscle-classifier combinations (e.g., BF-SVM, VM-Random Forest).  
- **Time-Domain Features**: Consistently moderate accuracy across most classifiers.  
- **Frequency-Domain Features**: Inconsistent performance; strong for certain combinations (e.g., ST-Decision Tree) but poor for others (e.g., RF-KNN).  

### Muscle-Specific Patterns  
- **BF (Biceps Femoris)**:  
  - Wavelet features + SVM yield the highest accuracy (90%).  
- **RF (Rectus Femoris)**:  
  - Decision Tree with Frequency-Domain features performs best (85%).  
- **ST (Semitendinosus)**:  
  - Random Forest and Decision Tree perform well with Frequency-Domain features (85%), though overall accuracy is lower compared to other muscles.  
- **VM (Vastus Medialis)**:  
  - SVM with Time-Domain features achieves the highest accuracy (90%).  

## Implications for EMG Signal Analysis  

### Classifier and Feature Selection  
- Tailored approaches are necessary as different classifiers and features perform best for specific muscles and signal characteristics.  
- **SVM**: The most robust classifier across feature types.  

### Wavelet Features  
- Particularly effective for BF and VM muscles, capturing transient and localized features in EMG signals.  

### Challenges in Frequency-Domain Features  
- While effective for some muscles (e.g., RF, ST), they exhibit inconsistent performance across others.  

### Muscle-Specific Signal Properties  
- **BF & VM**: Achieve higher classification accuracy, suggesting stronger separability in EMG signal patterns.  
- **RF & ST**: Lower overall accuracy, indicating more complex signal patterns.
