# Wearable Robotics Project: Binary Classifier for Gait EMG Signals

This project aims to design a binary classifier for gait Electromyography (EMG) signals using knee muscle data. Below are the steps and suggestions for improving the signal processing, feature extraction, classification, and future work to enhance performance, interpretability, and scalability.

## Project Overview

The goal is to classify EMG signals into two categories based on the knee muscle activity during gait. The following approach details the phases of the project:

1. **Signal Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**
2. **Binary Classification**
3. **K-Fold Cross Validation**
4. **Overfitting Detection & Dimensionality Reduction**
